# Final Project for "Deep Learning and AI Ethics" course @ Belmont F21

Models and data were not uploaded because of Github storage limits (I also had issues with commiting a repo with large files in it so decided just to upload everything besides the models & data.
I can send models and training data to you if interested, shoot me an email. jacob.stallings@pop.belmont.edu
