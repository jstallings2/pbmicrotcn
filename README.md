# pbmicrotcn

An exploration into audio effect modeling with Deep Learning using the [microtcn](https://github.com/csteinmetz1/micro-tcn) model from Christian Steinmetz. The model was trained on synthetic data for compression, reverb, and distortion generated using [Pedalboard](https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard) and the [SignalTrain dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/3824876)

This was my final project for the Dr. Scott Hawley's Deep Learning and AI Ethics course at Belmont University (Fall '21)
